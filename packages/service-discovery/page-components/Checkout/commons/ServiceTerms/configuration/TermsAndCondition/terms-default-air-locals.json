		"message": "The international press releases about the 'spreading of the corona virus' issue makes it abundantly clear that the impact on business activities in China and thus on global supply chains is very serious. The current space restrictions and rate developments make it impossible for COGOPORT to enter into binding rate agreements and logistical commitments for the affected routes, regardless of the type of transport (land, air, sea, train). In this respect the price quotations submitted for affected routes are subject to the reservation that the transport can be carried out without restriction. COGOPORT is neither able to foresee nor influence the unprecedented and unique restrictions in the performance of its transport services. COGOPORT accepts no liability for possible consequences arising in connection with the international freight against the spread of the corona virus with regard to the provision of services owed by COGOPORT. If it should no longer be possible for COGOPORT to execute the contract, or only to do so under modified conditions, COGOPORT expressly reserves the right to make the necessary adjustments or to withdraw from the contract - even partially. Any liability on the part of COGOPORT for direct or indirect losses incurred by the contracting partner in connection with the situation described is excluded. The contractual partner shall indemnify COGOPORT in full and upon first request from COGOPORT  against all costs and damages of any kind (including those resulting from third-party claims) which are incurred by COGOPORT in connection with the effects of combating the spread of the corona virus."
