					To succeed in this environment, you must equip yourselves with the knowledge and background of
					how global trade works. This is why I urge you all to focus on learning and self-training during
					the next two weeks, so that we can make the most of our time together when we meet again
					on your day-1. I am sure the team will be sending you all the necessary learning materials
					and content, so that you can make the most of this time.

				<div className={styles.text}>
					I am cancelling all my travel plans and meetings to dedicate as much time as possible to
					guide you during your first 2 days of joining. During this time, please do not
					hesitate to ask me anything related to Cogoport.

					Whether we &apos;ve met or not, I&apos; m positive that you all possess
					what it takes to succeed at Cogoport and to help us achieve our goals and grow
