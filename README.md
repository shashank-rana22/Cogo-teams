# cogo-admin


A `TurboRepo` for the optimized build system.


## Installation

- Clone the project from `Github` using `git clone git@github.com:Cogoport/cogo-admin.git`

- Use `pnpm install` to install all dependencies.

## Structure

`cogo-control`-  Is a single `NextJS` project to control whole admin.

`common` - Directory contains the code like `store, useRequest, form etc...`

`packages` Directory contains the individual services as package.

  

## Getting Started with new package

Create a directory `<package-name>` and navigate to the project using `cd packages/<package-name>`.

- Use `pnpm init` to create a `package.json`.

- Use this package in `cogo-control` by adding this package in `cogo-control`'s  `package.json` .
 ```sh
cogo-admin/cogo-control/package.json                                                 
 { 
  ...
 "<package-name>": "workspace:version"
  ...
 }

```

## With Typescript
- To support `Typescript` we need to add a `tsconfig.json` file.
-  We are using  `Rollup` for build.
- Add a file `rollup.config.js`and install the dependencies .

## Form
import {useForm,PillsController,SelectController,SelectController} from "@cogoport/form"

- for using a controlled element send the methods (from useForm) into controlled element and name, label, other options.
- label is optional

## Eg:  
const methods=useForm()
const {watch}=methods
-- (you can see other properties at https://react-hook-form.com/api/useform which can be extracted and send into useForm )

<form>
 <SelectController methods={methods} name="test" label="label test" options={[]} />
</form>
